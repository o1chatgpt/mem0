# Chat Interface Guide

The AI Family Toolkit is designed to be primarily controlled through its powerful chat interface. This guide explains how to effectively use chat commands to control the application.

## Basic Principles

The chat interface uses natural language processing to interpret your commands and execute the appropriate actions. You don't need to use exact syntax - the system understands variations and can extract the relevant information from your messages.

## Command Categories

### Workflow Management

| Command Pattern | Example | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| "Create a task to..." | "Create a task to research AI trends" | Creates a new task with the specified description |
| "Assign task to..." | "Assign task to Lyra" | Assigns the current or last mentioned task to the specified AI Family member |
| "Set deadline for..." | "Set deadline for research task to next Friday" | Sets a deadline for the specified task |
| "Show tasks for..." | "Show tasks for Stan" | Displays all tasks assigned to the specified AI Family member |
| "Create workflow for..." | "Create workflow for blog production" | Creates a new workflow with the specified name |

### Image Generation

| Command Pattern | Example | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| "Generate image of..." | "Generate image of a futuristic city" | Creates an image based on the description |
| "Create image with style..." | "Create image with style watercolor of a mountain landscape" | Generates an image with the specified style |
| "Make a [size] image of..." | "Make a large image of a cat" | Creates an image with the specified size |
| "Generate variations of..." | "Generate variations of the last image" | Creates variations of the most recently generated image |

### Document Analysis

| Command Pattern | Example | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| "Analyze this document" | "Analyze this document" (with attachment) | Processes and analyzes the attached document |
| "Summarize this PDF" | "Summarize this PDF" (with PDF attachment) | Creates a summary of the attached PDF |
| "Extract data from..." | "Extract data from this spreadsheet" (with attachment) | Extracts structured data from the attached file |
| "What's in this image?" | "What's in this image?" (with image attachment) | Analyzes and describes the content of an image |

### Team Coordination

| Command Pattern | Example | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| "Schedule meeting with..." | "Schedule meeting with Sophia and Lyra for tomorrow" | Creates a meeting in the calendar |
| "Notify team about..." | "Notify team about project deadline change" | Sends a notification to all team members |
| "Ask Lyra to review..." | "Ask Lyra to review the data analysis" | Creates a review request assigned to Lyra |

## Advanced Techniques

### Chaining Commands

You can chain multiple commands in a single message:

"Create a task to write a blog post, assign it to Sophia, and set the deadline to next Tuesday"

### Contextual Commands

The system maintains context, so you can refer to previous items:

1. "Generate an image of a mountain landscape"
2. "Now make it in watercolor style" (refers to the previously generated image)

### Command Modifiers

Add modifiers to refine your commands:

- Priority: "Create a high-priority task to fix the bug"
- Urgency: "Generate this image urgently"
- Visibility: "Create a private task for personal notes"

## Tips for Effective Command Use

1. **Be Clear and Specific**: While the system can understand variations, being specific helps ensure accurate execution.

2. **Check Command Results**: After issuing a command, check the result to ensure it was interpreted correctly.

3. **Use Natural Language**: You don't need to use robotic commands - speak naturally as if talking to a human assistant.

4. **Leverage Context**: The system remembers previous commands and content, so you can build on previous interactions.

5. **Explore Suggestions**: The chat interface provides suggestions based on your current context - these can help you discover available commands.

## Troubleshooting

If a command isn't recognized:

1. Try rephrasing it using different words
2. Break complex commands into simpler ones
3. Check if you're using the correct terminology for the feature
4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the requested action
